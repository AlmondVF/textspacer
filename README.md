THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

This is designed as a Natural Language Processing tool, specifically created to assist me with the National Cipher Challenge.

Eventually this should accept any input of text in English and automatically clean it, and then add spaces in the correct places.
 
Currently although it does work, it is nowhere near as good as it can be, as at the moment it does not have any sort of contextual spacing and therefore it may space ashe as a she instead of as he, which although a correct possible spacing, may not be correct in the context of the sentence.
